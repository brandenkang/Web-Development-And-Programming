                I held her like a childhood toy and fell asleep. 

                In the morning we went to the supermarket. She walked ahead of me and I pushed the trolley. As we ploughed through the piles of items that had fallen and spread across the floors, we gathered what we needed to eat today. There was no need to grab more.  
                
                She looked around the empty streets and I fixed my eyes on her. It had been a while since the quiet had settled in. She asked me if I could give her a trolley ride tomorrow. 
                
                I took her back into the supermarket. She hugged the plastic bags of food and let me lift her into the trolley. Everything had to be done today. 
                
                It all started in January. 
                
                People began to disappear. Every morning we woke up to someone we knew not existing anymore. Vanished without a trace with the last piece of clothing they were wearing – as if they had never lived. When ten percent of the population was gone, we believed the missing would one day come back, and we held onto the remnants of their existence. When twenty percent of the population was gone, we fell into chaos and madness consumed society. The streets were filled with pale faces and bloodshot eyes of those who had stayed up in fear of disappearing with the dawn. When half of the population was gone, sin prevailed and plagued our world. People never said “goodbye” anymore; the words had become ominous. When eighty percent was gone, we did nothing. Food always filled the racks of stores and money was worthless. Humanity was surprisingly quiet in facing its end. 
                
                When her parents disappeared, they left an outline of their tightly held bodies on the bed. She cried like a baby and I held her until she fell asleep.
                
                Next morning, the elderly woman living downstairs knocked on our door. Her husband and kids had disappeared. She was lonely, and asked if she could stay with us. I refused. She smiled in compliant silence as I closed the door. She hung herself that evening.  
                
                We cooked in the kitchen and ate in the living room. We shared one apron, one plate of pasta, and one bowl of soup. For god’s sake I wanted to share one fucking spoon too. She stopped chewing her food and asked me if I loved her and I couldn’t answer. We had split apart because I left her, and we met again when there was only a tenth of us left. I think I love her, but sometimes I doubt whether I still would’ve even if she wasn’t the only option left. The thought made me flinch.
                
                She began to chew only after forcing me to say that I love her. We walked back to the room and flipped open a book. We didn’t read every night, but when we did we stayed on the same page. 
                
                I laid in bed with her and we stared into the moonlit skyline. The city stood in the grayness like a hazy picture sprawled across the earth. 
                
                “I can feel it,” she said.
                
                “What?” 
                
                “Why did you leave me?” She asked. 	
                
                I thought about how foolish I had been. How I hadn’t realized how much she meant to me. But saying ‘I’ll make it up to you” or “I’ll do better” doesn’t mean much in a world where tomorrow can’t be promised. So I didn’t say anything.
                    
                “Promise me we would disappear together,” she said. 
                
                Her breathing became soft and I got out of bed. Her silhouette enchanted me. Like every other night, I decided to stay awake and watch over her. As the hours of the night went by, I was torn between the desire to wake her from uncertainty and the desire to let her sleep in peace. When she wakes up, I’d fall asleep, and she’d watch over me. And we’d only be able to spend a few hours of tomorrow aware of each other’s presence. As the thought drifted in my head I blinked my eyes, for stretches of seconds at a time.  
                
                She was gone when I woke up.  
                
                I went to the supermarket. I filled the trolley with a bottle of orange juice, some garlic bread, pasta, and tomato sauce. I slowly pushed the trolley home. 
                    
                It was unbearably light. 
                
                I cooked and poured myself a glass of orange juice. I ate the pasta. I wiped the tomato sauce off the plate with garlic bread and ate that too. The meal took fifteen minutes. It was enough time for me to realize that I was alone. 
                
                I took a few sleeping pills and forced myself to sleep. I had a dream that she stood in the kitchen and smiled at me, shining under a ray of sunlight. I couldn’t move my body. I knew I was dreaming but I didn’t want to open my eyes. We stood in the light until we became transparent. And at that moment I realized where everyone disappeared.

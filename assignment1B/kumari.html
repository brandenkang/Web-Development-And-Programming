        The goddess’s beauty stole the heart of every man and woman who looked at her. She had eyes like a black pearl, the eyelashes of a cow, thighs of a deer, and the voice of an innocent child. The gold jewellery around her neck and wrists, and her rose-tinted skin only slightly added to her charm as she often roamed the human world. Each night before returning to the heavens, the goddess visited the king in his palace, where they played games of dice and discussed the well being of the country. One unfortunate night, the king, intoxicated by the allure of the goddess, laid his hands on her. The goddess turned in fury, and told the king she would curse his entire country, which would suffer under his name. The king repented immediately and begged for mercy. After years of refusing to respond to his prayers, the goddess declared she would reappear in the body of a young girl ought to be worshipped by the nation, and that every thousand years she would grant the wish of a human who prayed before her. 

        …

        “One dollar! One dollar!” Screamed the two girls, trying desperately to catch my attention. They were holding colourfully braided bracelets in their hands.  

        “Sorry,” I replied with a pitiful look, as I walked through the slums of Nepal. White, sunburned, and carrying a backpack, I was a blatant tourist, bound to be impeded by merchants trying to rip me off and beggars clawing at my trousers. 

        “One dollar!” They persisted, now waving the bracelets in my face. 

        “No, Sorry.” I said, trying to scurry away. 

        “Do you want service?” Asked the girls, following my footsteps. 
        “What white men come here for.” 

        “What?” I felt my face flush. “I’m not that kind of —” before I could tell them to go away, they simultaneously reached for my arm with their dainty hands and yanked it towards them. 

        “The tourists love our sister,” said one of them, cheerfully leading me into an alley. 
        “She’s really pretty — she used to be a goddess!” Said the other one. 

        I could’ve easily broken free, but for some reason I followed in silence. The alley was bustling with people going about in their own ways. I stared at my feet as I stepped across repeating patterns of black and red blocks, and almost ran over the girls who had come to a sudden halt. 

        As the girls ran toward the end of the path, my eyes followed through, and stopped at a woman holding her arms open for them. She was dressed in a red garment made of cloth that covered her from her shoulders to her knees. She stared at me with a blank expression, but her dark eyes spoke of tragedy, and she stood like a withering flower amidst the smell of trash. Under a ray of sunlight seeping through the roof of the slums she glimmered, and I squinted at the beauty of the fallen goddess.  

        I approached her, and she slowly let me be a part of her world. She told me about her life as a former Kumari (Nepalese ‘living goddess’), and how things had turned out for her over the years. The Nepalese had a centuries-old tradition of appointing a young girl, aged between three to five, to serve as a Kumari for the country. The Kumari would enter the king’s palace, and her family would be given a large sum of money. Like most other candidates, she had volunteered to save her family from financial desperation. To be chosen, she had to meet thirty-two standards of beauty as signs of resemblance to the traditional goddess, and persist through several tests to prove her serenity and boldness. 

        “The final test was the most difficult,” she said. “A dozen goats and cows were slaughtered, and their heads were placed in a dark room with me. Masked men danced and sang about, and the scent of dripping blood pervaded the air. I had to spend the whole night trying to hide my trembling hands.”
                
        For years she lived a life of luxury, never leaving the royal palace unless there was a special occurrence. And because she wasn’t allowed to set her feet on the ground, she was carried around on a palanquin everywhere she desired to roam. 

        “The life of a princess,” I remarked, and she said coldly, “A princess who lost enough muscle in her calves to cripple her from walking like a normal person.”

        Her life as a Kumari ended when she turned twelve, the night her bed sheets flowered in red. Menstruation was a sign that she had lost her purity as a divinity, hence an indication that she must be removed from the title. She was kicked out into the slums of Nepal, where the people, including her own family, considered cursed and abandoned the delegated goddess. 

        “That’s all,” she said, “From being on humanity’s height to reaching its bottom.” 

        I wanted to save her from the two-faced world that made a fool of her.

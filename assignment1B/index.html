                <h3>"Gone"</h3>
                <p>
                    "Gone" is set in a post-apocalpytic world, in which the vast majority of the population has disappeared into thin air. 
                    The protagonist has figured out that people disappear during their sleep, and tries to protect himself and his girlfriend 
                    from the mysterious disaster.

                <h3>"Kumari"</h3>
                <p>
                    "Kumari" is based on the ancient Nepalese tradition, in which a young girl is chosen to symbolically represent and serve as a Goddess.
                    The protagonist, a tourist in Nepal, discovers that this seemingly glamorous tradition is not as good as it seems.
                </p>
                <h3>"Daddy Manual"</h3>
                <p>
                    "Daddy Manual" is about a former baseball player who is suffering with ALS. He spends his days laying on a hospital bed, 
                    hooked up to medical equiment and devices. His seven-year-old daughter thinks he's actually turning into a robot.
